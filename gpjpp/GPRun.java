/**
 * Abstract class that encapsulates the details of running a
 * genetic programming test in a Java console application.<p>
 *
 * The user must override two methods of this class: createNodeSet(),
 * which defines the branch structure and the node types used in
 * each branch of each tree; and createPopulation(), which creates
 * an instance of a user-defined subclass of GPPopulation.<p>
 *
 * It is common to override another method of this class:
 * createVariables(), which creates an instance of GPVariables with
 * the default configuration parameters for the run. Frequently you
 * may need to add problem-specific configuration variables (the size
 * of an ant trail, e.g.), which is best done by subclassing
 * GPVariables and overriding createVariables() to create an instance
 * of your own class.<p>
 *
 * GPRun then handles numerous details of managing a test run. These
 * include:<p>
 *
 * 1. Initializing the random number generator used by gpjpp.<p>
 *
 * 2. Reading a configuration file so that most properties of the
 *    test run can be adjusted without recompiling. Also creates
 *    a default configuration file if the named one isn't found.<p>
 *
 * 3. Creating output files for run statistics and detailed
 *    population reporting.<p>
 *
 * 4. Registering all necessary classes with the stream manager.<p>
 *
 * 5. Trapping all exceptions to report a detailed stack trace
 *    in case of error.<p>
 *
 * 6. Loading a previous checkpoint stream if found, or creating
 *    an initial population of individuals.<p>
 *
 * 7. Displaying status output to the console window and also
 *    printing configurable output to report files.<p>
 *
 * 8. Streaming a checkpoint file after a configurable number of
 *    generations in case a long run needs to be interrupted.<p>
 *
 * 9. Running a configurable number of generations and terminating
 *    the run when a configurable fitness target is reached.<p>
 *
 * 10.Writing configurable reports on the best individual at the
 *    end of a run, including graphic images of its tree structure
 *    and possibly its fitness performance (such as the trail of
 *    an ant or a lawnmower).<p>
 *
 * 11.Running multiple runs until a configurable number of good
 *    runs is found, and timing each run's performance.<p>
 *
 * GPRun is divided into a number of reasonably small routines so
 * that additional aspects of its behavior can be customized by
 * creating a subclass. Nevertheless, it is not suitable for
 * writing applets or other graphics-intensive Java applications. 
 * These could be written by using the lower level classes of gpjpp 
 * directly, since these classes enforce no user interface of their own.<p>
 *
 * @version 1.0
