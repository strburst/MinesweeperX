/**
 * Used to draw graphic images of the results of the genetic
 * algorithm. Most commonly, it is used to draw a graphic rendition
 * of genetic program trees. It can also be used to draw other
 * images such as the path followed by a mower in the lawnmower
 * problem.
 *
 * Because the rest of gpjpp is designed without any user interface,
 * this class attempts to shoehorn graphics into the library with
 * minimal side effects, which turned out to be surprisingly 
 * difficult. The technique chosen was to create a subclass
 * of Java's standard AWT Frame class, to add a single Canvas to
 * this frame, and to create an off-screen Image where the drawing 
 * is performed relative to the Canvas. Then the freeware class
 * Acme.JPM.Encoders.GifEncoder is used to write the graphic image to
 * a gif file for viewing in a web browser, drawing program, or
 * word processor.<p>
 *
 * In my experience using Java console applications running under 
 * the Microsoft J++ 1.1 VM in Windows 95, creating a GPDrawing
 * object causes the console window to temporarily lose focus until
 * the GPDrawing.dispose() method (inherited from Frame) is called.
 * See <a href="gpjpp.GPRun.html#showFinalGeneration">
 * GPRun.showFinalGeneration</a> for an example. Although the effect 
 * can be disconcerting, a mouse click returns focus to any
 * window you desire without disturbing the drawing process. 
 * Numerous experiments have not uncovered a solution. The same effect 
 * does <em>not</em> occur under the Sun VM.<p>
 *
 * The <a href="gpjpp.GPGenePrint.html#_top_">GPGenePrint</a> and 
 * LawnGP classes show examples of drawing images with GPDrawing. 
 * If you just want to create gif files of the genetic trees, 
 * set <a href="gpjpp.GPVariables.html#PrintTree">PrintTree</a> 
 * to true in your configuration file and don't worry about the rest.
 *
 * @version 1.0
